# Let's Document My Life

Who knows how long, I might just give up on this idea after a week, maybe it'll last a year, or maybe it can last my entire lifetime.

Why:
- To organise my thoughts and knowledge (hence called PKM)
- Understand current goals and constraints to plan my actions
- To look back at previous experiences and optimise for the future
